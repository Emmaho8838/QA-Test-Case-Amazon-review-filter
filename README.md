# 🧪 UX Bug Report and Test Case on Amazon Product Review Filters

Hi, I'm Emma Ho, and this is a real-world usability issue I discovered on Amazon.com while testing their clothing product pages.

This project includes:
- ✅ A test case to reproduce the issue
- 🐞 A bug report / UX improvement suggestion
- 📸 (Optional) Screenshots or screen recording of the issue

## 🔍 Problem Summary
When viewing product reviews for an item with multiple color/size options, the "Filter by" option only shows the **currently selected variant**. This limits visibility into reviews for other variants unless users manually switch the product.
